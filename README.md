TweakDeck
=========================

Google Chrome extension for Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare, developed further from the old Tweetdeck. Supports many things that the official one does not. Add endless amount of Twitter-accounts and Facebook-pages, like, reply and favorite straight from the app, etc...

Background story
--------------

Twitter updated Tweetdeck in December 2011 and since then it has been lacking most of the best features for power users.

I'm Chrome user and used Tweetdeck since forever. But since the update, it's totally unusable. I found a copy of the old beta crx file and modified it to my needs. Inspired by Android app Tweakdeck, Tweakdeck for Chrome was born!

On other platforms
--------------

Similar app can be installed on Android (not by me). It is also developed further from abandoned Tweetdeck. [Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modaco.thedeck.android.app&hl=en).

Please note
--------------

Even though I have made some minor modifications and fixes to this app, **I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS APP**, all praise goes to Twitter/Tweetdeck co.

Installation
--------------

How to install?

- Install Chrome if you don't have it already (stable preferred, dev does not always work)
- Uninstall official Tweetdeck if you have it installed (you can always use [the official one](http://web.tweetdeck.com))
- Download this git repo by clicking ZIP button in the top of this page
- Locate tweatdeck.crx file, go to menu > Settings > Extensions (or type chrome://chrome/extensions/ to address bar), drag and drop tweakdeck.crx to Chrome window.
- Have fun!
