Twitter updated Tweetdeck in December 2011 and since then it has been
lacking most of the best features for power users.

I'm Chrome user and used Tweetdeck forever. But since the update, it's
totally unusable. I found a copy of the old beta crx file and modified
it to my needs. Inspired by Android app Tweakdeck, Tweakdeck for
Chrome was born!

Remember to install on Android:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modaco.thedeck.android.app&hl=en

I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS APP, all praise goes to Twitter/Tweetdeck co.

How to install?

1. Install Chrome if you don't have it already (stable preferred, dev does not always work)
2. Uninstall official Tweetdeck.
3. Download this git repo by clicking ZIP button in the top of this page
4. Locate tweatdeck.crx file, drag and drop tweakdeck.crx to Chrome window (title bar to be sure), or go to Extensions > Install, and install.
5. Have fun!
