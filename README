Twitter updated Tweetdeck in December 2011 and since then it has been
lacking most of the best features for power users.

I'm Chrome user and used Tweetdeck forever. But since the update, it's
totally unusable. I found a copy of the old beta crx file and modified
it to my needs. Inspired by Android app Tweakdeck, Tweakdeck for
Chrome was born!

I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THIS APP, all praise goes to Twitter/Tweetdeck co.

How to install?

1. Ensure you have the latest Chrome dev version installed.

For Windows:

For Mac:

For Linux:

2. Uninstall official Tweetdeck.
3. Right click tweakdeck.crx and save it to your computer.
4. Locate file, drag and drop tweakdeck.crx to Chrome window (title bar to be sure) and install.
